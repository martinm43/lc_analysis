This is a little project I made to get and update NBA data from any platform, store it in a database, 
and predict the likelihood of various NBA teams making the playoff. Uses Monte Carlo simulations (a regular loop based simulation,
and a much faster, though more memory intensive, loop based simulation)

Done for fun and wanting to learn some Python, Git, iPython, Eclipse...

MAM - June 2017.
