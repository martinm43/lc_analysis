This is a little project I made to get NBA data using an API that 
scrapes data from official sources, stores it in a database, 
and predicst the likelihood of various NBA teams making the playoffs.
It (the folder) can run on any platform with a Python installation. 
Uses Monte Carlo simulations (a regular loop based simulation,
and a much faster, though more memory intensive, vector based 
simulation)

Done for fun and wanting to learn some Python, Git, iPython, Eclipse...

MAM - June 2017.

MAM - Now about to implement folder functionality in order to better organize work. "Folders/module" version will be new branch 
      until all files can be confirmed as working.
